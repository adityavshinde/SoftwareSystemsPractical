Linux is an open-source operating system based on Unix known for its stability, security, and flexibility. It powers various devices, from personal computers and servers to smartphones. The kernel, the core component, manages hardware resources and facilitates software communication. Users can customize and distribute their own versions, called distributions, like Ubuntu and Fedora. Developers and system administrators favor Linux for its powerful command-line interface and extensive programming support.
